[1] the background of AI-driven vehicle detection

VEHICLE DETECTION

In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, object detection has emerged as a groundbreaking technology. The “Vehicle Detection” model by Plugger (2024) is a prime example, accurately identifying vehicles in images with advanced computer vision. This scalable and efficient system has wide-ranging applications, from traffic management to urban planning, revolutionizing how we interact with visual data and reshaping various industries.

Using the latest techniques, Plugger’s model analyzes pixel-level features to detect various vehicle types, even in challenging conditions like low light or bad weather. Its precision and versatility make it indispensable for tasks such as traffic flow optimization and security surveillance. By automating vehicle identification, this technology streamlines processes and unlocks new possibilities for innovation and efficiency across different sectors.

ADVANCED VEHICLE DETECTION SYSTEMS

The integration of various technologies, such as video cameras, radar, Lidar, magnetic sensors, and thermal cameras, in vehicle detection systems forms the backbone of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These systems offer accurate and swift detection, essential for ensuring safer roads and smoother traffic flow. These technologies assist states, cities, and towns nationwide in meeting the increasing demands on the surface transportation system. Vehicle detection and surveillance technologies are integral parts of ITS, as they gather all or part of the data used in ITS. It is estimated that an investment in ITS will allow for fewer miles of road to be built, thus reducing the cost of mitigating recurring congestion by approximately 35 percent nationwide (Apogee/Hagler Bailly, 1998).

[3] methodologies for real-time detection in cycling environments

CYCLING DETECTION: REAL-TIME METHODS

Yaqoob et al. (2023), entitled “Detection of anomalies in cycling behavior with convolutional neural network and deep learning,” published in the European Transport Research Review, presents a relevant contribution to the field of bicyclist safety and real-time detection in cycling environments.

In this study, Yaqoob et al. explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques to detect anomalies in cycling behavior. Utilizing advanced machine learning methods, the authors aim to enhance the identification of irregularities or potentially hazardous situations encountered by cyclists on the road.

This research aligns closely with the objectives of the proposed “BeST-DAD” approach, as it demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in analyzing cycling data to improve safety outcomes. By integrating insights from Yaqoob et al.’s study with other relevant literature on real-time detection methodologies, the research paper can further strengthen the theoretical foundation and practical implementation of the BeST-DAD system for mitigating critical safety events for bicyclists in urban environments.

ENHANCING CYCLING SAFETY: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS

The global promotion of cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation has led to the implementation of policy frameworks in many countries to encourage its growth. Alongside increased cycling activity comes the concern for safety, as evidenced by rising rates of collisions, injuries, and fatalities. This literature review explores the important role of safety within cycling policy and investigates the extent of injuries associated with cycling through an analysis of available data sources, including police reports spanning the last fifteen years and recent hospital records on accidents. By identifying deficiencies in current data collection methods, the study aims to propose strategies for enhancing both cycling and safety policies to mitigate accident risks and promote safer cycling environments. This review draws primarily from the research conducted by Short and Caulfield (2014) in their paper titled “The Safety Challenge of Increased Cycling,” which examines the intersection of cycling promotion and safety policies, emphasizing the need for comprehensive approaches to address safety concerns within cycling promotion efforts.

ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING

Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, has attracted significant attention for its transformative potential across various domains. Rooted in the goal of creating intelligent systems that mimic the human brain, deep learning has become increasingly integral to modern technological advancements. The term “deep learning” was introduced by Rina Dechter in 1986, reflecting a paradigm shift towards hierarchical feature learning through multiple layers of neural networks. This approach enables systems to process complex data types, such as images, text, and audio, with remarkable accuracy and efficiency (Saadat & Muhammad, 2020).

The evolution of deep learning has been fueled by advancements in theory, algorithms, and computational resources. Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques form the foundation of deep learning, allowing models to learn from labeled data or discover patterns in unlabeled data, respectively. While supervised learning enables precise predictions based on past experiences, unsupervised learning facilitates the exploration of hidden structures within data. Moreover, ongoing research efforts focus on addressing challenges and expanding the scope of deep learning applications. Future directions include improving model interpretability, addressing data privacy concerns, and enhancing the scalability of deep learning systems (Saadat & Muhammad, 2020).
