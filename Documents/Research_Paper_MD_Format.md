<h1 align="center"> CHAPTER 1 : The Problem </h1>

## Introduction

The new era of mobility employs new technologies such as sensors and wireless communication to achieve a more sustainable, reliable, and safer environment for road users (Storme et al., 2021).
Numerous studies have been published concerning relevant new technologies and systems like Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) (Milakis et al., 2017) as well as electronic vehicle systems such as Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). For instance, ADAS assist drivers by warning them when the vehicle fails to keep within the road lanes, or the Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) system which adjusts the speed of the vehicle (Van der Pas Et al., 2012).

Unlike motor-vehicle transport, the implementation of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and C-ITS in cycling has not been comprehensively investigated (Gadsby & Watkins, 2020), even though cycling offers several benefits both to society and the environment (WHO, 2022).
Cycling is one of the most sustainable and green transportation modes. These advantages include the relief of congestion, the reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions and improvements in the well-being of cyclists (Useche et al., 2019; Whitaker, 2005). Many people worldwide have been switching to bicycles, especially to e-bikes, and cycling has increased even more due to the Covid pandemic (Buehler & Pucher, 2021).

In Metro Manila, the capital of the Philippines, there have been notable efforts to promote cycling as an alternative mode of transportation. Infrastructure improvements, such as bike lanes and bike parking facilities, and initiatives to promote cycling, such as bike-sharing programs and public campaigns, have been implemented in recent years. However, despite these efforts, the number of bicycle-related road crashes has seen an alarming increase in 2021. According to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), there were a total of 2,397 bicycle-related road crashes in 2021, resulting in 33 deaths, 1,719 non-fatal injuries, and 645 incidents of property damage. These statistics highlight the urgent need for solutions to improve the safety of cyclists on the roads.

To bridge this technological gap and address the pressing need for cyclist safety, this paper introduces an AI-driven vehicle detection system tailored specifically for cyclists. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, this system aims to detect and interact with cyclists on the road, enhancing their safety and promoting confidence among riders. The alert system device developed through this research will play a important role in providing timely warnings to cyclists about potential hazards on the road, thereby minimizing the risk of accidents and fatalities.

## Objectives of the Study

The main objective of this study is to develop an AI-driven vehicle detection for cyclists by utilizing artificial intelligence to detect and interact with cyclists on the road. Specifically, it aimed to:

1. Design an auditory alert system;
2. Determine the performance of the AI model in detecting vehicle in terms of:
   - precision,
   - recall,
   - and F-score
3. Test the functionality and usability of the developed system or device.

## Scope and Limitations

This research focuses on the development of an AI-driven vehicle detection system aimed at improving cyclist safety on roadways by detecting nearby vehicles and pedestrians. The device utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and operates specifically on road environments. The study considers practical implementation factors, including cost-effectiveness and accessibility, with the intended beneficiaries being cyclists, developers, engineers, and policymakers.

The device integrates a wide-angle camera positioned either at the rear of the bicycle or within the rider's vicinity, offering a detection range of up to 3 meters. Furthermore, it will activate an alert signal upon detecting a vehicle passing within a safety threshold of less than 1 meter.

Limitations of this research include its specific focus on developing an AI-driven vehicle detection system solely for enhancing cyclist safety, excluding other forms of transportation or road users. The camera's detection range is confined to the rear vicinity of the bicycle or sitting area, limited to 3 meters. While the system targets detecting vehicles and humans within this range, it may overlook other potential road hazards. Additionally, factors like environmental conditions, road infrastructure, and user behavior, which impact the system's effectiveness, are not comprehensively addressed. Furthermore, regulatory and legal considerations regarding the system's deployment on public roads are beyond the study's scope.

## Significance of the Study

This research on AI-driven vehicle detection for cyclists holds significant importance and potential benefits for various stakeholders:

- **Cyclists.** Cyclists are the primary beneficiaries of the AI-driven vehicle detection system, as it aims to enhance their safety on the road by detecting and interacting with vehicles. Their input and experiences are crucial for informing the development and refinement of the system, ensuring its effectiveness and user-friendliness in real-world cycling scenarios.

- **Transportation Authorities and Policymakers.** The implementation of advanced safety solutions for cyclists contributes to the creation of safer and more cyclist-friendly urban environments. By understanding the effectiveness of AI-driven safety technologies, policymakers can make informed decisions regarding infrastructure investments and safety regulations, ultimately improving road safety for cyclists and other road users.

- **Public and Private Institutions.** The AI-driven vehicle detection system developed in this research will benefit public and private institutions by enhancing cyclist safety and promoting accessibility. Schools, universities, and other organizations can utilize this technology to improve communication and interaction with cyclists, fostering inclusivity and creating safer environments for all road users.

- **Researchers.** Researchers benefit from this study by gaining insights into the application of AI algorithms for cyclist safety. It serves as a reference for future studies, guiding further exploration and innovation in the field of cyclist safety technologies.

- **Future Researchers.** Future researchers can build upon the findings of this study to explore additional enhancements, innovations, and applications of AI-driven vehicle detection for cyclists. The insights provided can serve as a foundation for designing new safety solutions and conducting further research in this important area of transportation safety.
